In the course we will program in the c-language. We will use the gcc compiler and 
the make utility to compile the code. How to install these are described below:

1) Linux:  We have prepared an easy-to-use installation script to
           do this on the Linux school computers.

           Download the install_gsl.sh file (this can be done in any
           directory). Run the following commands from the directory
           with the install_gsl.sh file:

           chmod u+x ./install_gsl.sh
           source ./install_gsl.sh

2) Mac OSX: The gcc compiler and make utility is part of the Command Line
            Tools in Xcode. Xcode can be downloaded for free in App Store.
            You can also install from homebrew, install instructions for
            hombrew can be found here: https://brew.sh/

3) Windows: The gcc compiler and make utility is part of the basic
            package of the MinGW software, which can be download from 
            http://www.mingw.org. Instructions on how to install and
            setup MinGW can be found on the Getting Starte page on the
            MinGW homepage. Once this is done you will obtain a
            linux-like terminal from where you can compile and run
            the code using linux commands.
